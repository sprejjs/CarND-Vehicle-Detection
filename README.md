# Vehicle Detection Project

In this project I have developed a pipeline to detect and track vehicles on a video using computer vision and machine learning. The project is written in Python with the help of OpenCV and SKLearn.

The project code can be found in the [Jupyter notebook](code.ipynb) or the [Html Output](code.html) of the same notebook.

Some technical details and discussions for this project can be found in the [write up file](writeup.md).

An example of the output can be [here](output_videos/project_video.mp4).
